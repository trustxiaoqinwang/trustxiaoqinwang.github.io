# summary of slide `Classification`

in most cases , which kind of model we should set depends on the class of dependent variable ,although the explanatory variable also have the following class. the examples in the parenthese is the corresponding cases in our slides.

-   quantitative
 -   contineous variable
 -   discrete
     1.  binary ( eg. Cropland ; Dose response)
     2.  multi-level (eg. Crop choice)
-   qualitative
  -   ordered (not yet cover)
  -   nominal
     1.  binary (eg. Vote)
     2.  multi-level (eg. Transportation;Ketup)

# how to do multinomial logit and probit regression in Stata
useful resourses about logit and probit model the most important resoursed is the stata help file .The main command you may use：
-   logit (binary)
-   mlogit(multi-level: individual-specific explanatory variable)
-   clogit(multi-level: alternative-specific explanatory variable )
-   asclogit(multi-level: both individual and alternative specific explanatory variable)

-   probit(binary)
-   mprobit(multi-level: individual-specific explanatory variable)
-   asmprobit(multi-level: both individual and alternative specific explanatory variable)
